#The only two tips you need for achieving "Inbox Zero"
I'm writing this on a Friday morning, knowing that one og my goals for today will be getting to "Inbox Zero" before heading out for the weekend.

I used to have a terrible habit of using my inbox as a "to do" list, which at the time I thought was a good thing. I'd see other people's inboxes with thousands of emails and scoff, heh, mine only had a few dozen, or perhaps a hundred threads in it!

##Why isn't using your inbox as a to do list a good thing?
The problem is, using your inbox as a to do list means you're setting yourself up to act on the emails, likely via email. Now, if your workflow is based *entirely* in email, that might make sense, but for a lot of us, something that can get done in email is also an opportunity to have a quick IM or chat, or better yet, a face to face meeting. By "meeting" I don't mean "yet another agenda-less soul suck time waster" - just getting up and going and talking to someone is an oft-suggested way to get something done.

So, this leads to my first tip:

> Use a separate "to do" list, with each item capturing the essence of what you want to get done from an email thread, then move the thread to another folder or archive it. Come back to it **if** you decide to complete the to do item by email, but consider finding another method.

##I replied to an email, and I need to keep it around to remember to follow up if I don't hear back
This is the second thing that plagued my thinking - I'd get a lot of anxiety that people wouldn't reply, and if I didn't keep the thread around, I'd forget about it myself
