xxx better, more balanced headline

In my ongoing exploration of Snapchat, my biggest frustration is the issues of "discoverabilty" - the UI of the app supports a number of ways for you to be found, but no directory of users to find people with similar interests.

This week an in-Snapchat Buzzfeed story titled "xxxxx" brought my attention to Ghostcodes - an app the provides such a directory.

It's a well put-together app, with good onboarding and a nice flow to the directory. It was easy to list my profile and the added features of interests and a video (which I didn't do) are nice.

After posting my profile, I sat back and waited to see if I would be discovered. I started getting a lot of "Kudos" (euqivalent to a "Like") on my profile listing, and also several people downloaded my SnapCode. However, as near as I can tell, I haven't gotten any new "Friends" on SnapChat from this.

The Kudos are essentially vanity metrics. At best, they might serve as a social signal for what profiles are better-constructed, but they don't add much value than the little bit of validation that at least someone is seeing my profile - and maybe that's their point - possibly reducing user churn and creating repeat usage, but they certainly aren't driving the outcome.

xx-try the follow / unfollow method

xx-is Ghostcodes owned by Buzzfeed? - so was the post an ad / FTC
