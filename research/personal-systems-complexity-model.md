# Personal Systems Complexity Model (PSCM)

A too fancy way of saying "I have too many apps and software-as-a-services in my life!"

So, I'm auditing what I use, what I use it for, the internconnection between them. Once the complexity is somewhat understood, I'll focus on areas of it to determine if things can be simplified - possibly through new small products, or possibly through the elimination of some systems where overlap exists.

## 00 Sketch
I tried to draw out a sample isometric topography of the concept, but that devolved into realizing that I first needed some kind of Sankey/flow diagram. So, I'm going to create that first, then work up to the illustration.

## 01 App Audit (Google Spreadsheet)
This is the first identified need / next step from the sketch, and will become the source for the Sankey/flow diagram.

_Work in Progress:_
